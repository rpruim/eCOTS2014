Every course we teach has logistics.  The way we handle logistics has changed over time. 

**Logistics Techniques**

* Lecture / blackboard for broadcasting information
* Mimeograph -> Photocopy for providing a syllabus, etc.
* Floppy disks, "H: drive" for distributing files
* Computer lab machines -> student-owned laptops
* Links to HTML files 
* Course specific web sites
* Course support software (e.g. Moodle)

Many old-time techniques are still good, but some of them are not well suited to teaching with computation and not well integrated with R.

## Logistical Needs

Here are some basic areas needed for just about every R-based class.  

1. Providing R
#. Distributing data files
#. Distributing class notes
#. Distributing R commands

These same areas apply to other software: JMP, Python, Matlab, Mathematica, etc.

## Providing R

Some Options:

* Install R/RStudio on lab machines
* Install R/RStudio on student machines
* Use an R/RStudio server

### Many beginning students: Use a server

Every student has a Facebook account, so they already have access to the hardware they need.

#### Advantages

- No student set up
- Everyone has exactly the same interface
- Dogs can't possible eat their computer.
- Students can share their account with you --- you can see what's wrong to help them.
- Update of version and packages is centralized

#### Disadvantages

- Possible load problems 
    - Hundreds of students simultaneously in class
    - Thousands of students asynchronously
- Working with your IT Department.  Some are great, others have limited resources.
    - Work-around, as necessary.  A server can be set up on the Cloud, e.g. Amazon Web Services.  Good documentation of process for sys-admins. 
    
## Distributing Data Files

* Students download files and use basic R functions to read them in, e.g. `read.csv()`
* Give students links to data files on web server.  Again, use the basic R functions, e.g.
    ```{r results='hide'}
read.csv("http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5098197/StatisticalModeling/mydata1.csv")
    ```
* Functions for reading in files with short names, e.g. `mosaic::fetchData()`
* Existing packages, e.g. `data(Galton, package='mosaic')`
* Shared, editable files (e.g. for group projects)

and even ...

* Your own package for your own course.

### Students Download Files

**Problems**

* Students may not put files where they should.
* Uploading files to RStudio Server can be confusing.  Students don't understand that the server is another machine running another operating system.
* Students will use the wrong R function.
* Updating is a nightmare.

**Advantages**

NONE

## Links to Data Files on Web Server

Of course, that's how you would distribute files for download.

Rather than posting a link to the file, post the **command** for reading in the file to the current data session.

```{r}
todaysData <- read.csv(file="http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5098197/StatisticalModeling/mydata1.csv")
```


Students cut-and-paste the command from course web site to their R session.

**TIPS**

Make sure the protocol is `http://`, not `https://`

Use tinyurl.com` to translate your long URL to a short one.
```{r}
fetchData("http://tinyurl.com/q9pbn7t")
```

**Advantages**

* Easy to find, use, and to update data.
* Posting command minimizes possibilities for typing mistakes.
* Many datasets already on book sites, e.g. Lock^5


## Functions for reading in files with short names

Set up a web repository for files.  Write a function that looks up short names on that repository.

Example:
```{r}
G <- mosaic::fetchData("Dome.csv")
```

**Advantages**

* Easy to use new data sets in class: one step process

**Disadvantages**

* Writing such a function is not trivial for newbies
* `mosaic::fetchData()` doesn't automatically connect to **your** repository, just the `mosaic` one.


## Existing Packages

Packages are the standard way for distributing R software.  They also provide facilities for data, for notes, and for Rmd templates.

The data set you want to use may already exist in a CRAN or other package.

Command to access the data:

* Loaded packages : e.g. `data(Galton)` or sometimes just `Galton`
* Installed but unloaded packages: `data(BOD, package='datasets')`

Finding the data you want:

* Look at packages on CRAN etc.  Get list by naming the package, e.g. 
```
data(package='datasets')
```
There are thousands of datasets available.

## Shared, Simultaneously Editable Data

For student project collaborations, or ...

When collecting data from the class, let the students enter it for you.

* A nice way to teach about the organization of data.  You can see and show the class as it's being mis-entered.

### Google Spreadsheets

1. Create the blank spreadsheet.  You **must** use this link to your Google account: <https://g.co/oldsheets>
2. Enter as much of the data or format as you want.
3. Permit anyone with the link to edit ...
    ![sharing](Figures/GoogleShare.png)
3. Post that link on your web page so students can get to the file:
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Am13enSalO74dFBPVVZyTndFWlBndVVVSmpENGpPRFE&usp=sharing>
    - Go to `tinyurl.com` if you want to translate your link to a smaller form.  Here's this one: <http://tinyurl.com/pgwlljs> 
3. "Publish" the spreadsheet to the web.  (File/Publish to Web)
4. Get the link for the file in CSV format.
    ![Google publish](Figures/GooglePublish.png)
5. Post that link/command. Use `mosaic::fetch`, e.g.
```{r}
require(mosaic)
ECOTS <- fetchGoogle("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Am13enSalO74dFBPVVZyTndFWlBndVVVSmpENGpPRFE&single=true&gid=0&output=csv")
```

## Your own R Package

It's not hard to make a simple R package.  Include your data in the `data` directory of the package.

Example:
* The sources <https://github.com/dtkaplan/ECOTS-ICOTS-2014/tree/master/ECOTS/CourseR>
* Installation via
    ```{r eval=FALSE}
require(devtools)
install_github("dtkaplan/ECOTS-ICOTS-2014/ECOTS/CourseR")
help(dataDocExample)
```

## Distributing Class Notes

Use R/Markdown to write notes.

Options:

* Publish the notes to Rpubs.com and post link on your website
    - Example: <http://rpubs.com/dtkaplan/ecots-modeling>
    - Example: <http://rpubs.com/dtkaplan/ECOTS-logistics>
* Keep the html files on your web server.  
    Even better: Keep the sources there so that the notes will be updated automatically when you change them.
    Even better: Keep your RStudio Project on the web server. 
* Use an RStudio project linked to GitHub.  This is very powerful, but has a steep learning curve.

## Distributing R Commands

Suggestion: Use R Markdown and distribute the commands just like your class notes.  Give a link to the `.Rmd` file.

Have students copy and paste from their browser into the RStudio editor, and use "Chunks/Run All".  That will source the code.

### Emerging Techniques

RStudio has "templates."  These are currently distributed from packages.

From the `CourseR` package.

## Time for a Teach-with-R package

Make it easy for instructors to set up the logistics.
